# 🧠 MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Networks

This project builds and trains neural networks on the **MNIST dataset** to classify handwritten digits (0–9).  
It compares model performance with and without activation functions, shows overfitting, and demonstrates how to reduce it using regularization.
